Apps
====

introspect: invokes "well known" methods on a server to display the 
capabilities.

meerkat_client: similar to xmlrpc-c a client to access oreillys server.
Follow the links in the source header to find out more.

tests
=====

base64
------

tests to find out if base64/xml-escaping and utf8-conversion work. Output must 
be checked visually. (quick-n-dirty) See base64.out how it should look like.

httpfunc
--------

test pattern for decoding http messages. Useful mainly for debugging or with 
debug messages turned on.Visual checking needed. See httpfunc.out how it should look like.

xmlfunc
-------

test patterns for converting to/from xml-rpc and test for general usage of the 
rpc values like storing or retrieving values. 
Visual check needed: input == output. See xmlfunc.out how it should look like.

val1 client/server
------------------

implements the tests as proposed by userland. Should run 5000 times without 
error message.

http client/server
------------------

usage of the http server. The server has its root at c:\ulxmlrpcpp\httpd (see 
config-xyz.h for change). The files from ulxmlrpcpp/httpd must be copied 
there. Try with a web browser "localhost:32000" ! The client will then try to 
load/save/delete some files over http.

rpc client/server
-----------------

simple test suite with a function that is accessed by the client.

Using a tool like cppunit would have been nice but I thought to late about it. 
And I think it is already very good, if the samples just *run* without GPF 
:-) In case of doubt send me the output of the apps.

secure client/server
--------------------

Example, how to set up a secure server/client system using basic authentication
over http and ecrypting the transmitted data.
